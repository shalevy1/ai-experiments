# AI-Powered E-commerce Shopping Assistant

This project is an AI-powered e-commerce shopping assistant that helps users find and compare products effortlessly. It leverages large language models (LLMs), web search tools, and web scraping to provide a seamless shopping experience.

## Features

-   **Conversational Interface:** Interact with the AI assistant through a natural language chat interface.
-   **Product Category Identification:** The assistant can identify the product category from user input (text or image).
-   **Requirement Extraction:** It engages in a conversation to extract specific product requirements (e.g., budget, features, brand, size, color).
-   **Image-Based Search:** Users can upload images, and the AI will identify the product and generate a text query.
-   **Enhanced Search Queries:** The assistant refines user queries to improve search results.
-   **Web Search and Scraping:** It uses web search tools (Tavily or SerpApi) to find relevant product links and then scrapes product details from e-commerce websites.
-   **Product Comparison:** The AI generates a visually appealing HTML-based comparison of the found products.
-   **Multiple LLM Support:** Supports Groq, OpenAI, and Gemini language models.
- **Multiple Search Tool Support**: Supports Tavily and SerpApi search tools.
- **Firecrawl**: Uses Firecrawl for web scraping.
- **Streamlit**: Uses Streamlit for the user interface.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

-   **`app.py`:** The main Streamlit application that handles user interaction and orchestrates the workflow.
-   **`conversation.py`:** Contains the `ConversationAgent` and `CategoryIdentification` classes for conversational requirement extraction.
-   **`shopping_team.py`:** Contains the `ShoppingTeam` workflow, which manages the search, scraping, and comparison agents.
-   **`image_processing.py`:** Contains the `ProductImageProcessingAgent` for image-based product identification.
-   **`utils.py`:** Utility functions for getting models and search tools.
-   **`instructions.py`:** Contains the instructions for the different agents.
-   **`expCrawl.py`:** A file for testing the `product_comparison_agent`.
- **`travel-agent`**: A folder containing the code for a travel agent.
- **`hrapp`**: A folder containing the code for a HR app.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone clone https://github.com/vivekpathania/ai-experiments
    cd ecom-shopping-assistant
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    This will start the Streamlit application, and you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1.  **Set API Keys:**
    -   In the sidebar, select the LLM provider (Groq or OpenAI) and the search tool (Tavily or SerpApi).
    -   Enter your API keys for the selected services.
    -   Click "Set keys".

2.  **Start a Conversation:**
    -   In the chat input, type your product search query (e.g., "I'm looking for a blue denim jeans under $100").
    -   The AI assistant will engage in a conversation to gather more details.
    - You can also upload an image to search for a product.

3.  **View Product Comparison:**
    -   Once the AI has enough information, it will fetch product recommendations and display a comparison in HTML format.

4. **Clear Conversation**:
    - You can clear the conversation by clicking on the "Clear Conversation" button in the sidebar.
